# Demo-Forum-Member-Microservice

This project includes all the member related function for [demo-forum](https://www.google.com). The microservice is designed to run on security environment instead of public cloud or any sort.

The member microservice would provide the following service.

  - Creation and editing member
  - Generaten and renew JWT for login credential
  - validate the JWT expiry date (check changing password within the expiry date)

## API doc
For localhost environment: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Tech

This micoservice deploy the following technology and project

* [Spring boot] - service code backend
* [Spring security] - Handle login process and generate JWT token
* [Spring data] - Handle JPA

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Build

Demo-Forum-Member-Microservice requires gradle v6.5.1+ to run.

```sh
$ gradle build
$ gradle bootRun
```

For deploying localhost...

```sh
$ gradle bootRunDev
```

### Testing API with swagger

For default setting, the swagger panel is in 
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/member-rest-controller

Here is the way to get the JWT with curl command

```sh
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{
    "email": "xxx@yyy.com",
    "password": "abcd1234"
}' http://localhost:8080/rest/login
```

copy the JWT from response header starting from Bearer xxx to the swagger autherisation tab and all the API is ready for testing.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
